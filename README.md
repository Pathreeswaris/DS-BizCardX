BizCardX: Extracting Business Card Data with OCR
BizCardX is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information includes the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code. The extracted information is displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI). Users can save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database can store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information.
